__label__-1 "i ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy . it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear . the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions . it was n't as elegant as the model pic ( is it ever ? ) and for this price should fit like a glove . went back within seconds . also it 's pretty short and bulky short is n't flattering on too many people ."

__label__0 "very cute top and nice material but the fit is strange . there 's a reason that the model has her arms at her side . the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small but the body is very loose . the sleeves are full probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected . also the arm hole is wide so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt which creates an awkward silhouette . i normally love designs by whit but i 'm not sure about this one"

__label__1 "needed a pair of grey pants to go with some of my jewel colored tops . hei hei is my favorite brand of pants and these did not disappoint . they fit like a glove and are true to size . i do n't think the picture does them justice . if you like comfort you certainly will not go wrong with these pants . you can wear them year round except in the heat of the summer . i would not hesitate to purchase them ."
__label__0 "i bought the s ; came with a tag saying sz 8. it is in fact more like a size 2 if not 0. the bust is probably a 34 a or b or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in . i ca n't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it so i will return it . the fabric design is as spectacular as it looks though ... very good quality ."
__label__-1 "this dress is adorable in the photo ; however in reality it fits like a tent . the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it . it flares out in the skirt to become an a-line and it 's just not very flattering . if i had read the reviews before ordering i would have sized down but i ordered before any reviews had been posted . sadly i must return ."
__label__0 "i likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit . my bra showed . i am about a d cup smallish in other proportions ( 125 5 ' 6 ) and no bra worked with this so that i would n't have to worry about my bra showing . nice fabric and drape . maybe good for someone who does n't need a bra ?"
__label__0 "i loved the blue brocade since it 's a little unusual paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon ! my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap - fortunately it does n't . the top of the dress was fitted ( i wore my usual size ) . what i did n't expect though is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon which runs just below the bust . the photo online shows a li"

__label__0 "i wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii . i sized up when i saw the side zip because i 'm a little larger in the top than bottom but whoa ... even when sizing up i think i would have needed to size up like 3x to get this to work . the dress is adorable and if you have a smaller bust it will work for you ... so sad it would n't work for me ."

__label__0 "the design of this dress is darling and so unique and it 's very well made . but i agree it 's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame . i 'm 5 ' 3 and ordered the 2 and it was like wearing a hospital gown . if a petite were available i 'd have tried that but this one 's going back . shame too because it 's adorable . the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut but that 's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high ."

__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this shirt . the fit was great and the fabric just felt beautiful . luxurious soft and flowing . but the collar was frayed ... in addition the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship . i put it aside to return it then this morning went to have another look at it wanting to talk myself back into it . but i ca n't overlook the fact i 'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn . it may be only this"

__label__-1 "this is a cute dress but not for me . 1. i think it runs very small 2. it is super textured so if you do n't want to add bulk ( aka pounds ) to your frame this probably is n't for you . it 's too bad it 's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first . i 'm sure it 's probably adorable on smaller thinner people . unfortunately mine is going back ."

__label__-1 "note the sleeves on the model . that is how your regular size will fit your arms . however even if you have skinny arms like i do the sleeves will be tight . i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in . i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested . the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon ."

__label__1 "i was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand but i 'm a little unsure . the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5 ' 4 frame yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides . i 'm just not sure it hangs right on me . it 's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely and looks great with the front loosely tucked . just not what i was expecting ."

__label__0 "these pants are cute . they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model . they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt . these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly . since they already run a bit big this is a major negative . i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home . by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants ."

__label__0 "the color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person . the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i 'd imagined from the photos . it has a quilted quality so does n't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms . i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large . i think a medium might have been better . have n't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return . has an artsy cool professor vibe that i like ."

__label__1 "this is ruching done right ! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well . it is fitted but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places . it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything . so unless this particular color is your nemesis this dress is a winner !"

__label__0 "construction excellent . the dress was pretty big around the hip ... does not have a shape like seen in the picture . the fabric was beautiful but was stiff ... like furniture . the color was not as vibrant as the picture . returned ."

__label__0 "this is a flattering comfortable soft sweater the instant you put it on . a few instants after that however i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity . i 'm not optimistic about its longevity and would n't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer ."
__label__0 "i was so disappointed when i received this top . the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture . the back is cute but not worth the awful drab actual color ."

__label__0 "loved this jumper i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer ( with jumpers it 's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach ) so thought this one would probably be a medium . but it was definitely baggy/lose . otherwise i would 've totally kept it !"

__label__1 "oh look i have a booty and would look at that -- i have a waist too ! yes this dress is way casual for its price point ( soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color ) but it 's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove . i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body . wish there were more colors available i would pick them up in a heartbeat . i purchased the medium petite . my stats for fit reference : 5 ' 3 tall 140 # 36dd 28 waist 35 hips wide"

__label__1 "i love anna sui 's lines makeup to everything . this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on i could n't see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow . the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big . the hem is lovely scalloped . each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress there is no wow that justifies the full price tag . now that it 's on sale i 'll keep it probably for summer ."
__label__1 "love this skirt ! it 's definitely on the tight side but is a stretchy material . i 'm between a 6 and an 8 and went with the six because i liked the way it hugged my curves . as an hourglass shape i sometimes have problems finding pencil skirts - they either fit in the hips and are big at the waitband or the other way around . this one fit great throughout and was both slimming in the front and flattering in the back . i was also worried that if i tucked anything into this skirt there would be weird"

__label__0 "unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering . i considered trying a smaller size but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it ."

__label__0 "this dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front . i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face . all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx . $ 250 was too much to spend on this ."
__label__-1 "i saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on . i 'm 5-7 flat chested 135 pounds and i ordered a size small . the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms . this sweater will work great if you are short . consider making your sweaters a little longer because i do not consider myself tall ."
__label__0 "this is a beautiful and warm sweater well cut and easy to dress up or down . the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing especially against wool or cashmere winter coats ."
__label__-1 "i loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store . i am 5 ' 5 with a slender build . i tried my usual xs but could n't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline . the band is so small even fully stretched out . i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder ... i gave up after wrestling with it . i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me ... funny ... but not funny ."
__label__-1 "this dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out . however the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers . i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big . the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short . while the design is beautiful there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling . for reference i am 24 waist"

__label__1 "love this blouse . the owl design is flawless front to back . the material has a silk like feeling . i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer . if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you . also i am a 38 c and the chest fit well ( in size large ) but would not offer much more room for a larger chest . if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows i would size up . i love the unique design !"
__label__0 "i love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work . welp that 's out the window . this design is poor . for one this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i do n't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his . this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso . so without a jacket i would never wear this . it 's very low cut .. the back is very low .. it 's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4 ."
__label__1 "i love this sweatshirt . it 's super chic and sexy ( and for those of us that need actual support it looks great with a strappy sports bra ) . that said selling this as one size fits all is misleading at best . i 'm 5 ' 2 ~160 ( a lot of it muscle but i enjoy chorizo ) a 34ddd and this fit me perfectly but i ca n't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12. just be real -- this is a smedium . one star removed for the one size fits all fallacy ."
__label__-1 "very poorly made- wide and short very unflattering . the material is advertised as cotton but it felt very synthetic ."
__label__0 "i ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design . the blue was much more of a dark navy not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture . the picture also shows it tying on the side . it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress . it was not at all flattering on me . one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer ."
__label__0 "okay so this top has its redeeming qualities i promise ! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two . but it 's just not worth 2 because i 'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable . for people who purchase this it will last forever . it 's sturdy cotton not thin like many retailer tee materials . the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice . it 's a great looking top . my issue though was n't with the bust as other reviewers hav"
__label__-1 "i do not even know where to begin with this product . i ordered a small ( i go between small and medium ) and felt that would be a good fit . after trying on the shirt i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is . this shirt is very boxy . i know its supposed to have a 'flow ' to it but this shirt is too much . it needs to be taken in . or have a belt wrapped around it . i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering . i found this color to be very blah . overall i am slig"
__label__1 "actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute . i like the look it adds . i really want to get more colors . i normally wear everything from retailer in small and even though this fit it was small for a small . i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium ."
__label__1 "this caught my eye straight away and it has n't disappointed on either . really unique and i imagine it will suit many different occasions . high quality and slimming vertical stripes too ."
__label__0 "looks better online than in person . material makes it look a little puffy"
__label__1 "this skirt is perfect ! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth . the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch . i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year 's eve and had many compliments ! it runs a tad big . i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected . i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway . my new favorite !"
__label__0 "love the colors in this top . it 's a shame it was so big and baggy i 'm not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5 ' 6 130 # . athlete . size small was way too much material for my frame"
__label__1 "i almost passed this in the store but i am glad that i tried it ! i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a blouse feel ... and is machine washable ! yay ! love nice blouses that do n't need to be dry cleaned ! i would describe the material as thicker so some may not like this for warmer weather . looks great with a long necklace like the minuet ! i am typically a small and purchased this in an extra-small and still have plenty of room ."
__label__0 "this piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms or if you are a t-rex . if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms this top may not be for you ."
__label__0 "i totally agree with the first review . i thought this was soooo cute on the model but it 's loose fitting and has no shape to it ."
__label__1 "great arm coverage soft material flattering fit . wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts . i really should purchase another color for summer work staple ."
__label__1 "the print is even better in person ! true to size . flattering fit ."
__label__1 "i tried on the grey motif yesterday and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved and the only thing i bought . i 'm 5 ' 4 34 dd 125 lbs and the xs was a perfect fit for me . i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms so i generally wear a small but i tried on the small and the arms were a bit baggy . i plan on wearing tanks underneath so the xs was the right call . if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath go with your usual size ."
__label__1 "really like the quality color and overall design of these jeans . they ran a little long on me but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties . i did n't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed . so glad that was the case given the price tag on them . i am 5 ' 7 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed . definitely recommend these jeans"
__label__0 "the shade of orange was quite muddy and not vibrant like photos show . it 's going back ."
__label__1 "this romper checks off all the boxes ! it 's beautiful and the fit is perfect !"
__label__-1 "this was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity -- and especially at this length ! unfortunately this is a mess in terms of proportions . if a size 2 can barely get it off then there is a design flaw . sadly the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws ."
__label__1 "for once i found a peasant top that was n't a balloon . i 'm 5 ' 1 and curvier on top and the small fit great . the blouse billowed a bit but it did n't make me look like a hot air balloon . the pattern of the blouse a mix of various floral swatches is very pretty . the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall . i ca n't wait to wear it !"
__label__1 "first i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention . with that said i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to dressed up or down . so .... i found myself ordering it asap paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing . well i received it in the mail and it was better than i thought ! ! ! the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture . i personally love this article/pattern of art as i see it as an exp"
__label__-1 "perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts or the cut of this was not right for me but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders did n't lay right on me . sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned . i am 5 ' 5 135lbs 34c curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small ."
__label__0 "it 's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size ( i 'm a 36dd ) and it makes it this much harder . i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price . when it arrived i was so excited ! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items ! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage . i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem . the too itself is gorgeous ! i did"
__label__1 "obsessed with this sweatshirt ! it 's a must have for any loungewear lover . i 'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose relaxed look . i was afraid it would swallow me but i love the fit ! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute . the fabric is a great texture great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring . love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans . worth every penny ! ! !"
__label__1 "i love the fabric since it 's fall was n't expecting it to be light . but its not heavy either . just the right balance . this is one of those classics . i love the collage like pattern of the fabric . the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots . ( dressed up or down ) ."
__label__0 "i am so in love with this skirt but unfortunately it runs at least one size small ... since i am a 16 there is no sizing up . the color quality and style are perfection but i would say this runs as more true to junior 's sizing than a regular women 's size . so sad because it will be going back ."
__label__0 "it really is such a cute romper . took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable . that is in till i washed it . i 'm in europe so there are n't dryers ... washed it in cold water line-dried it and it shrunk . significantly . it still fits but the top does n't blouse over like it previously did . and the shorts feel really short . so disappointed . my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water"
__label__1 "i was n't immediately attracted to this shirt but decided to try it on . i loved it on ! it is comfortable and very flattering . i 'm a small person and the length was n't overbearing on me . it was full but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person . i 'm not sure how it works on a fuller person but my guess is it may surprise you !"

__label__0 "the material looked much nicer in the online picture . also- there are pockets which added a bulk to it that was not flattering on me ."
__label__0 "it breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues . i am not a fan of dolman sleeves ( they make me look big and bulky ) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing . it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality . i could see this working better on someone tall and thin ."
__label__0 "ordered this online in the pinkish color . the material is a little thin . as a busty curvy lady this one just did n't sit right ran a tad large and looked boxy . if you have a thinner frame may be a better look for you . detailing is nice ."

__label__1 "this is the jacket i 've been looking for ! i love the collar/lapels - they can lay flat or be worn up a bit . the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft . the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy . i got the black but it 's really more of a charcoal black vs. jet black . the color/dye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast . when zipped it 's form fitting but not tight ( tts - i 'm 120 lbs"

__label__1 "cute top but does stretch out a bit throughout the day ."
__label__-1 "the material is horrible it 's heavy and cheap . the skirt does not flow as it appears in the photo . instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles . am returning ."
__label__-1 "if you have anything larger than an a cup this shirt will likely not fit right . it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest . it literally runs right through the center of the breasts . what were they thinking ? if it had been three inches higher or lower it would have been perfect . for reference i 'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup ."

__label__-1 "i see all the amazing reviews and on one hand i agree with them . but these pants do run huge and they do n't fit tailored like on the model . on me they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they 're super wrinkly . you 'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i 'm surprised to see the comment saying they 're wrinkle resistant . they are n't . also the kahki is more grey which i do n't love . i got these on sale but even at $ 50 i just ca n't justify keeping them . they 're super comfy but"
